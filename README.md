# Title : restaurant_bill_generator

# Description : 

A project written entirely in C++ which allows a restaurant manger to generate a bill for an order placed. The script uses the command line to intake data, and later generates a bill in a .TXT file.

# Installation : 

Download the project from GitHub to a Unix/Linux enviornment. The download will take place as a compressed file, so it will have to be decompressed. 

# Running The Programme:
Once all files are ready, compile the main.cc file using the make command. Once the compilation is done, run the generated executable main file, and the programme is ready to run. Feel free to ammend the items in the restaurant menu that can be done in the menu_item.cc file.  

Once you run the programme, the programme will ask you for your name, as the server. Next, it will ask for an item ordered, followed by the quanity of that item. You can use the item names or menu_number as written in the menu_item.cc file. Enter "delete" to delete the last item. 

When the order is complete, click "end" to generate the bill, or "end_staff" to apply the staff discount as well. The bill will be generated.
